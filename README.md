Every year millions of accidents are reported all around the world out of which the US has plenty of cases noted. Many circumstances lead to accidents which include natural calamities or lack of safety measures taken by an individual. It's necessary to know the outcomes and analyse the causes of accidents to take possible actions to prevent such accidents from happening in future. The visualisation presents accidents occurring in 49 states of the United States with CA as the leading country with the largest number of accidents. Further, it is observed that most of the accidents appeared when the weather was clear and fair. Road features are observed to study the causes in deeper. 

The three visualization questions that I worked on after exploring data are  
1.	What is the state-wise accidents across the country and what time of the day did the accidents occur?  
2.	Does the weather affect the accident numbers?  
3.	What is the severity of accidents in the state with the highest number of accidents?

Detailed Visualization is explained in the report file (US_Car_Accidents.pdf) and in an audio file(zoom_0.mp4).
